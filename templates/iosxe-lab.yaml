# It defines the parameters used to start two Cisco c8000v virtual routers on our
# type-2 hypervisors. The hypervisor is configured with Open vSwitch (OVS) to
# connect and manage both virtual and physical networks.
#
# Each virtual router has 3 interfaces:
# - GigabitEthernet1: dedicated to management and automation (DevNet)
# - GigabitEthernet2: first data plane interface
# - GigabitEthernet3: second data plane interface
#
# This configuration mimics the Cisco ISR4321 physical router which is present in
# our lab rooms with the same interface layout:
# - GigabitEthernet0: management interface
# - GigabitEthernet0/0/1: first data plane interface
# - GigabitEthernet0/0/2: second data plane interface
