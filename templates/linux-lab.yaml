# This template file is part of https://inetdoc.net project
#
# It defines the parameters used to start Linux virtual machines on our type-2
# hypervisors. The hypervisor is configured with Open vSwitch (OVS) to connect
# and manage both virtual and physical networks.
#
# YAML key definitions:
# - kvm: Container for virtual machine definitions.
#   - vms: List of virtual machines.
#     - vm_name: Name of the virtual machine.
#     - os: Operating system type (e.g., linux).
#     - master_image: Base image file used for the VM.
#     - force_copy: Boolean flag indicating whether to force copy the master image.
#     - memory: Amount of memory (in MB) allocated for the VM.
#     - tapnum: Tap interface number for network configuration.
#     - devices: List of devices to attach to the VM.
#       - storage: List of storage devices to attach to the VM.
#         - dev_name: Name of the supplemental disk file with its extension to set format.
#         - type: Type of device (e.g., disk).
#         - size: Size of the disk.
#         - bus: Bus type (e.g., scsi, virtio, nvme).
