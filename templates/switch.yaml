# It defines the configuration parameters for the Open vSwitch hypervisor ports
# used by virtual machines. This YAML declaration file is used by the switch-conf.py
# script to set up the network connectivity for virtual machines.

# Students have sudo access to run ovs-vsctl commands. They can configure:
# - access ports with VLAN tagging
# - trunk ports with multiple VLANs
