# It defines the parameters used to launch a minimal Linux virtual machine
# on a type-2 hypervisor using KVM. This minimal example launches only one
# virtual machine with basic configuration.
#
# YAML key definitions:
# - kvm: Container for virtual machine definitions.
#   - vms: List of virtual machines.
#     - vm_name: Name of the virtual machine.
#     - os: Operating system type (e.g., linux).
#     - master_image: Base image file used for the VM.
#     - force_copy: Boolean flag indicating whether to force copy the master image.
#     - memory: Amount of memory (in MB) allocated for the VM.
#     - tapnum: Tap interface number for network configuration.
